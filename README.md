# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This is a timed javascript quiz. I coded this from scratch using the knowledge I obtained from my bootcamp. This one was quite the challenge and I had to do a lot of research. The objective was to create a timed quiz. Once you started the quiz, a timer of 75 seconds began to count down. I had to create the questions and answers in javascript for this quiz. I decided to use a seperate js file for the questions so my code can operate/look cleaner. If a user were to answer incorrectly, a deduction in seconds should be taken away from the timer. Whatever score is left on the timer results in your score. The user can enter in their initals and submit their results to a list of their overall best scores. On the homepage, there is also a clickable link to view the best scores. All scores are logged in the console as well. Overall, this project was a good challenge for me to implement my skills using event listeners, functions, and utilizing the DOM tree elements.
